# Slope and Roughness from DEMs

This project generates **slope** and **roughness** maps from **Digital Elevation Model** (DEM) data by fitting a plane to local elevation windows. **Slope** is derived from the plane‚Äôs gradient, while **roughness** is based on the dispersion of the **orthogonal residuals**.

## üß∞ How it Works

Commonly used slope algorithms, such as Horn's method, estimate slope based on local elevation differences across a small, fixed window (typically 3√ó3 pixels). By approximating partial derivatives using immediate neighbors, these methods are highly sensitive to noise and elevation variability, often leading to exaggerated slope values in areas with rough or noisy terrain.

Similarly, standard roughness metrics like the Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI) and Topographic Position Index (TPI) fail to account for underlying slope when assessing elevation variance. These methods calculate elevation differences between a central pixel and its neighbors, which means that a perfectly smooth but tilted surface produces non-zero roughness values. Consequently, the roughness values produced by these methods are affected by slope in a way that makes it difficult to isolate their individual contributions to topographic variation.

Despite these limitations, these approaches are widely used in GIS software such as GRASS, ArcGIS, and GDAL (the backend for QGIS).

This project improves upon traditional methods by calculating slope through **plane fitting** over a local neighborhood of each DEM pixel. Two methods are available:

- **Least Squares (LS)**: Fast and effective for most terrain.
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Slower, but more robust over highly variable or rugged terrain.  
  Unlike LS, which minimizes vertical residuals, SVD minimises **orthogonal residuals**, making it less sensitive to terrain anisotropy and better at preserving slope and roughness integrity in complex landscapes.

Once a plane is fitted, slope is derived from its gradient in the x and y directions and expressed in degrees. Roughness is computed independently of slope by analysing the dispersion of **orthogonal residuals** from the fitted plane. By measuring roughness in a direction perpendicular to the local slope trend, this approach ensures that roughness values truly reflect surface variability rather than being biased by overall terrain inclination.

The roughness can be quantified using one of three methods:

- **Range** (`range`): *Maximum minus minimum residuals*
- **Standard Deviation** (`std`): *The standard deviation of residuals*
- **Median Absolute Deviation** (`mad`): *The median absolute deviation of residuals*

Unlike traditional approaches, this method also allows for a flexible, sliding-window application beyond a fixed 3√ó3 neighborhood. Larger window sizes (e.g., 9√ó9 pixels) can be used to incorporate more data points, producing smoother and more reliable slope and roughness estimates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Guide

First, make sure you have installed the required packages. This can be done via:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To generate the slope and roughness maps, simply run **dem_to_slope_and_roughness.py** from the command line with the following arguments:

- **DEM_PATH** (string): *The path to the DEM file.*
- **DEM_RESOLUTION** (string): *The resolution of the DEM in meters.*
- **WINDOW_SIZE** (int): *The size of the window around each pixel in meters over which slope and roughness will be calculated.*
- **ROUGHNESS_METHOD** (int): *The method used to calculate roughness. Options: 'range' (minimum-to-maximum difference), 'std' (standard deviation), 'mad' (median absolute deviation). Defaults to 'range'.*
- --**METHOD** (optional, string) *The fitting method used to compute the local slope plane. Options: 'ls' (least squares), 'svd' (singular value decomposition). Defaults to 'svd'.*
- --**N_PROCESSES** (optional, int): *The number of processes to use for computation. Defaults to using all available CPU cores.*
- --**TILE_SIZE** (optional, int): *The size of tiles in pixels for processing large DEMs efficiently. Defaults to 256.*
